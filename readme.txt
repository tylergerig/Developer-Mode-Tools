Limit access to the WordPress for your clients. Block functionality like viewing certain menu items.

== Description ==

Developer Mode Tools makes it possible to easily disable certain parts of anything that isnt the admin panel for your clients, while keeping full control over all admin panel functionality for yourself and other developers.

The Developer Mode Tools plugin allows your clients to be presented with a clean WordPress admin interface with only the functionality they need - and nothing more. Let Developer Mode do the dirty work for you, and clean up your client's admin interface with just a few mouse clicks!

= Introduction =
Let's face it: Some of your clients might not know enough about WordPress to have as many options as you as a developer need, and some parts of your website are just not meant to be tampered with by them. This is where the Developer Mode Tools plugin steps in: it allows you to disable certain parts of the admin functionality in the other panels, such as updating plugins, viewing menu items and disabling specific plugins.

= Main options =
*	Hide menu items for non-admin users, but not for yourself
